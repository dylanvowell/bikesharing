# OVERVIEW
In order to determine whether or not implementing a bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA would be successful, we first looked at bike sharing data in New York City for the month of Auguest. By creating visualizations with the data in Tableau, we can identify trends that could help us answer important questions about the success rate of our current venture. 

# RESULTS
The data visualizations can be found here: [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dylan1351/viz/Module14Challenge_16485124051800/NYCCitibikeAnalysis)

You can infer a few important points by looking at the different slides: 
- Slide 1 tells us that the vast majority of trips are less than 10 minutes in length
- Slide 2 lets us know that males make up the bulk of all rides, and that all gender choices follow the same trip duration pattern
- Slides 3 through 5 shows that peak hours happen while people are going to and from work. This means that Mon-Fri, 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM are when the bikes are used most.
- slides 6 and 7 illustrate what bikes would need the most service, and what times of the day would be ideal to perform any upkeep or repairs. 

# SUMMARY
The results of this study conclude that not only is the Citi Bike program successful in terms of total rides per month (which is inferred by the number of rides seen per weekday in various slides), but also shows that there are definite patterns which can be utilized for repair logistics, marketing based on demographics, and subscription vs. pay-as-you-ride pricing models. While keeping the unique characteristics of Des Moines, IA and it's residents in mind, we can use this data to predict trends and establish a successful Citi Bike program ourselves.
